# NAME
    vidir - edit directory
    
# INSTALL

You can just use the binary at `./bin`.

# SYNOPSIS
    vidir [--verbose] [directory|file|-] ...

# DESCRIPTION
    vidir allows editing of the contents of a directory in a text editor. If
    no directory is specified, the current directory is edited.

    When editing a directory, each item in the directory will appear on its
    own numbered line. These numbers are how vidir keeps track of what items
    are changed. Delete lines to remove files from the directory, or edit
    filenames to rename files. You can also switch pairs of numbers to swap
    filenames.

    Note that if "-" is specified as the directory to edit, it reads a list
    of filenames from stdin and displays those for editing. Alternatively, a
    list of files can be specified on the command line.

# OPTIONS
